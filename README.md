# The Browser Extension Book

Hello there! I'm glad you found this project.

This is an ambitious project I have on writing a book about browser extensions. Extensions are an underrated feature in browsers
that, in my opinion, could be better explored given proper education about how to create one. Right now, the documents we rely
on are the [MDN docs on WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) and the [Chrome Extension API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_index) page, which I don't think are friendly for all audiences. Extensions are cool and powerful, but they can be easy to learn as well. That's why I started this project!

## What will this book cover?

Chapters proposed for this book and other information to be available in the [wiki](https://github.com/cezaraugusto/web-extensions-for-the-builders/wiki).

## I'd like to contribute!

The book is in an early stage at the moment, but I'd appreciate hearing your thoughts. Please shoot me a message via DM [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cezaraugusto). (DMs open).
